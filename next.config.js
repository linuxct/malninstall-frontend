        faqText: "<h2>What is malninstall?</h2><p>Malninstall is a tool that aims to help end-users remove potentially unwanted applications, such as rogue applications and malware.<br><br>Malninstall's initial focus was removing recent samples of Android malware, such as FluBot/Cabassous and TeaBot/NotFluBot/Anatsa/Toddler, but has since then shifted its target to potentially any Android application that is both signed with a known test key, as well as it preventing the user from uninstalling it.<h2>How can I use this tool?</h2><p>In order to use this tool, you will need to download a package manager application in the infected device, such as ML Manager.<br><br>After installing it, open the package manager application and look for the application that infected your device. It should be named “FedEx”, “Correos”, “DHL”, “MRW”, “bPost”, “UPS”, among others. In some rare cases, the application impersonates “Google Chrome”, “VLC”, or other well known application, you will be able to notice if that was the case if there are more than one of these applications installed, or Google Play Store allows you to download another copy of said application (i.e. You have VLC installed, but Google Play shows it is not installed).<br><br>Take note of the “package name” that appears right below the malware application. It could be named in multiple ways, and most likely the “package name” will be unique for your infection.<br><br><img src=/images/sample.png><br>Using the form, type the package name of the application that has infected your device. Complete the captcha and an application with said package name will be generated in the background. This application will serve as a replacement for the currently installed one, as it will overwrite the application entirely.<br><br>Install the newly downloaded application in the infected device, and the rogue application will be neutralized.<h2>How can I know this is safe?
